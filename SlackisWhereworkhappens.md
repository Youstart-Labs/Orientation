# Slack is Where work happens

```
Slack unifies your entire team's communications, making your workflow, well, flow a lot better. 
```
### Founder
```
founded by Stewart Butterfield
```
### History
```
Slack was launched in August 2013. In January 2015, Slack announced the acquisition of Screenhero.
In March 2015, Slack announced that it had been hacked over the course of four days in February 2015, and that some number of usersâ€™ data was compromised. That data included email addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, and, in some cases, phone numbers and Skype IDs that users had associated with their accounts. In response, Slack added two-factor authentication to their service.
```

### Channels in slack
```
The channels are super flexible and allow for public or private communication strings focused on project specific or role specific chat
```
 ### General chnanel in slack
 ```
 Every new Slack workspace starts with a #general channel. Itâ€™s unlike all other Slack channels because no one can leave it â€” that's what makes it so useful! It's a great place to share important messages; as workspaces grow larger, many opt to use the #general channel only for important announcements. You donâ€™t even need to invite anyone to #general: theyâ€™ll be added automatically when they join the workspace.
```
```
Tip: If you have an urgent message to share with the entire team, mention @everyone in #general. Ask people to react to your message so you know whoâ€™s seen it. ðŸ‘€
```
```
Everyone can see everything posted in #general, so we recommend discouraging unnecessary messages. There are a few options to help reinforce this
```
 ### Public chnanel in slack
```
Theyâ€™re used for conversations open to all members. Anything posted to a public channel is browsable and searchable by all members, except for Guests of your Slack workspace.
```
 ### Private chnanel in slack
```
Theyâ€™re for confidential discussions. You have to be invited to a private channel in order to see and search for its contents. A private channel has a lock icon next to its name.
```
### Shared chnanel in slack
```
A shared channel (beta) is a bridge connecting your workspace with another companyâ€™s Slack workspace. Itâ€™s a secure place to communicate and collaborate with external contacts.
